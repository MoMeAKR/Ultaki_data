# Ultaki_data
Repo holding the resulting conversations for Welcome to Ultaki: Exploring the relevance of Large Language Models for Accurate Behavioral Simulation in Energy Transition

# Ongoing work for adequate result display  

* We are currently working on a visualisation configuration that would allow easy access and understanding of the generated events and associated thoughts
* Meanwhile, the following configuration is can be `python-pickled`: 
    * Character description is available in indivs_background.pkl 
    * First experiment reports are available in `indivs.pkl` for the dictionnary key `base`
    * Second experiment reports are available in `indivs.pkl` for the dictionnary keys `base` and `pew`
    * Third experiment reports (using second order dynamics) are available in `second_order_dynamics.pkl`
    * Finally, the multi-agent experiment reports are available in `fs_comparison.pkl`
